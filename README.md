# What is a Turing machine?
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine can be constructed that is capable of simulating that algorithm's logic. 

The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete cells. The machine positions its head over a cell and "reads" the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a finite table of user-specified instructions, the machine writes a symbol in the cell, then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right, then (iii) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation (s. Wikipedia).

# How is the simulator made?
It is made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery.
